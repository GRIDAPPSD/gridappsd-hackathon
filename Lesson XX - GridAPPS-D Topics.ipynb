    "## Queue Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "`/queue/` is used for communication channels where only the GridAPPS-D Platform is listening to the API call. These API calls are processed on a first-in, first-out basis. There is only one subscriber to the communication channel.\n",

    "\n",

The particular topic for such an API call will change between simulations and instances, and so shortcut functions are provided in GridAPPSD-Python library to assist in generating the correct Topic.\n",
