2. Install the GridAPPS-D Docker Containers
===========================================

Change directories into the **gridappsd-docker** folder and start the
latest stable release of the GridAPPS-D platform.

-  ``cd gridappsd-docker``

-  ``./run.sh``



It is possible to specify a particular release tag using the -t option
and the release tag

-  ``./run.sh -t develop`` - use the ``develop`` branch with latest beta
   features

-  ``./run.sh -t releases_2021.03.0`` - use the March 2021 release

-  ``./run.sh -t releases_2020.09.0`` - use the September 2020 release

A complete set of release is available in the `associated readthedocs

Wait for the platform to download the required docker containers. This
is a very large package and will take several minutes.

After the containers have finished downloading, they will automatically
be created and then launched:

3. Launch the GridAPPS-D Platform
=================================

When all the containers are running, the terminal will move inside the
docker enviroment, which has its own internal directories and path.

Start the GridAPPS-D platform inside the docker container by running

``./run-gridappsd.sh``

The GridAPPS-D platform is now installed and running.

To confirm, open `localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080/>`__ to access
the GridAPPS-D Visualization App:
