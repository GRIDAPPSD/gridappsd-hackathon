    "A key concept in GridAPPS-D and CIM XML power system models is the difference between the object mRID of a piece of equipment and multiple measurement mRIDs associated with its control settings and power flow values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements differ from the state variables (e.g. those obtained from State Estimator or a power flow calculation) in that the values are measured here and not calculated or estimated. Each Measurement is associated to a _PowerSystemResource_, and in GridAPPS-D for now, also a Terminal that belongs to the same _PowerSystemResource_. (Non-electrical measurements, for example weather, would not have the Terminal). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __POS__ -- Position for switches and transformer taps\n",
    "\n",
    "Each measurement object has a __name__, __mRID__, and __phases__. In GridAPPS-D, each phase is measured individually so multi-phase codes like ABC should not be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pos measurements will be discrete, for such things as tap position, switch position, or capacitor bank position. \n",
    "\n",
    "The others will be Analog, with magnitude and optional angle in degrees. \n",
