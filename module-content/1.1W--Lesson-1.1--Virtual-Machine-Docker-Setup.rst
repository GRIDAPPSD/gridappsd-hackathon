Virtual Machine & Docker Setup
==============================

A typical Windows 10 installation does not include several of the tools
needed to run the GridAPPS-D Platform Several software packages need to
be installed prior to installing GridAPPS-D in the next step

Installation Steps:

-  `1. Verify System Requirements <#1.-Verify-System-Requirements>`__

-  `2. Verify OS Build <#2.-Verify-OS-Build>`__

-  `3. Install Windows Subsystem for
   Linux <#3.-Install-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux>`__

   -  `3.1. Enable WSL <#3.1.-Enable-WSL>`__

   -  `3.2. Upgrade to WSL2 <#3.2.-Upgrade-to-WSL2>`__

   -  `3.3. Install Linux Ubuntu OS <#3.3.-Install-Linux-Ubuntu-OS>`__

   -  `3.4. Set up Ubuntu in WSL <#3.4.-Set-up-Ubuntu-in-WSL>`__

-  `4. Install Docker for Windows <#4.-Install-Docker-for-Windows>`__

1. Verify System Requirements
=============================

-  **OS:**

   -  Windows 10, Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher

-  **RAM:**

   -  8GB (*absolute minimum* for 13 and 123 node models, *may encounter
      memory overload during installation* );
   -  16GB (preferred for small models, minimum for 8500/9500 node
      models);
   -  32GB (recommended for application development)

-  **Disk Space:**

   -  15GB required for installation

**Note:** The download size is quite large, so it is recommended to use
a fiber or ethernet interent connection, rathered than a metered hotspot
to avoid excessive data usage charges.

2. Verify OS Build
==================

To check your OS build, type ``winver`` in the Cortana seach bar:

   :alt: .

   .

Check to see if your OS is

-  For x64 systems: **Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or
   higher.**

-  For ARM64 systems: **Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or
   higher.**

   .

If not, run **Windows Update** to get the latest verion of Windows 10
available for your machine. It may take some time for the new OS to
download. Multiple restarts are typical while upgrading the windows
version.

--------------

3. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux
======================================

GridAPPS-D and the associated docker containers will run using the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which is a new feature to Windows 10
that enables linux code to run natively in Windows without a separate
virtual machine. The steps in this section are also available on the
`Microsoft
website <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`__

3.1. Enable WSL
---------------

Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator:

.. figure:: L1-1W-images/win_setup_open_powershell.png
   :alt: .

   .

Enable WSL by entering

``dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart``

.. figure:: L1-1W-images/win_setup_enable_wsl2.png
   :alt: .

   .

Then, without restarting, enable the virtual machine platform by
entering

``dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart``

.. figure:: L1-1W-images/win_setup_enable_VM.png
   :alt: .

   .

When completed, restart your machine. It may take a few minutes for the
new settings to be applied while restarting.

3.2. Upgrade to WSL2
--------------------

Download the latest WSL2 package .msi installer from the `Microsoft
repository <https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi>`__

Run the update package to install WSL2 using the wizard:

.. figure:: L1-1W-images/win_setup_WSL_wizard.png
   :alt: .

   .

Open Windows PowerShell again and update the settings to use WSL2 by
entering

``wsl --set-default-version 2``

--------------

3.3. Install Linux Ubuntu OS
----------------------------

Open the Microsoft Store app, and search for ``Ubuntu`` and install the
desired version (available versions are 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04)

   .

When it has finished downloading, click ``Launch``.

   .

3.4. Set up Ubuntu in WSL
-------------------------

Wait for the Ubuntu OS to install.

   :alt: .

   .

Select a username and password. These do not need to be the same as your
Windows or Microsoft Account login.

   .

4. Install Docker for Windows
=============================

Download and run **Docker Desktop for Windows** from `Docker
Hub <https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe>`__

Be sure to select “**Install required components for WSL2**”

.. figure:: L1-1W-images/win_setup_docker_wizard.png
   :alt: .

   .

After restarting your machine, Docker should start automatically, and
you will see a notification stating “**Linux WSL2 containers are
starting**”
